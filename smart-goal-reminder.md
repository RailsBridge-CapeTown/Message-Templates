Hello!

We hope you enjoyed the RailsBridge workshop and learned some good stuff. :)

Near the end of the day, we did the "Hey, buddy" activity (https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/workshop/activities#heybuddy) where you set yourself a SMART goal and swapped contact details with a buddy.

- How is your SMART goal going?
- Did you ask your buddy how they are doing with theirs?

Hope to see you at the next RailsBridge! ðŸ™Œ


Regards,

(Steve &) The RailsBridge Cape Town team
