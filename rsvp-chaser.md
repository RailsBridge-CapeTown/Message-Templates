## Body

Hello there.

We hope you're looking forward to the RailsBridge workshop on {{ date-of-workshop  }} as much as we are. :)

Looks like we're going to have a packed house. Yay! If you can't make it, please update your RSVP to No so that peeps on the waiting list can come to the workshop in your place.

Thank you!


Regards,

({{ your-name }}  &) The RailsBridge Cape Town team
