Hello!

We hope you're looking forward to the RailsBridge workshop on {{ date-of-workshop  }} as much as we are. :)

To get you thinking about stuff, please reply with answers to one of the questions below before the end of the day on {{ few-days-after-sending-this }}. We'll be discussing your answers at the workshop. Please note that if you don't reply to this message we'll assume you can't make it, and change your RSVP to No. Eep!

* What are three things you already know about programming?
* What do you plan to do with what you learn at the workshop?

Regards,

(Steve &) The RailsBridge Cape Town team
