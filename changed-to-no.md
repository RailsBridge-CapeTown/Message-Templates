Hi there.

We've switched your RSVP for the workshop to No because we didn't receive a reply from you about the warm-up questions. If this is isn't right and you are going to attend, please let us know. Thank you! :)

If you aren't going to attend this one, maybe we'll see you at the next one? {{ url for next one }}


Regards,
