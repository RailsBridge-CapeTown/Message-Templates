Sponsorship for RailsBridge Cape Town

# Body

Hi! :)

{{!-- Set The Scene --}}
{{ Intro saying hi and stuff. "Following up our chat the other day." }}

{{!-- Short RailsBridge reminder --}}
{{ RailsBridge Cape Town (https://railsbridgecapetown.org/) is the local chapter of RailsBridge (http://railsbridge.org/). || RailsBridge workshops are a free and fun way to get started or level up with Rails, Ruby, and other web technologies. || RailsBridge workshops are free courses targeted at groups of people that are underrepresented in tech. The courses cover an introduction to programming concepts, the available tools, Rails, Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. }}

{{!-- Call To Action --}}
**Can you provide sponsorship for RailsBridge on {{ date }} ({{ meetup URL }})? We need {{ amount. About R2,000 at time of writing. }} for breakfast and lunch for our attendees.**

{{!-- Return On Investment --}}
Sponsoring a RailsBridge is a great way to show that your organisation values diversity, inclusion, and openness. You can read lots more on our sponsorship page (https://railsbridgecapetown.org/sponsorship.html).


Thank you!

Regards,

({{your name}} &) The RailsBridge Cape Town team
